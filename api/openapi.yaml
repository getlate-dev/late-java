    get:
      description: |
        Returns analytics for posts. If postId is provided, returns analytics for a single post.
        Otherwise returns a paginated list of posts with overview stats.

        **Important: Understanding Post IDs**

        This endpoint uses two types of posts:
        - **Late Posts** - Posts scheduled/created via the Late API (e.g., via `POST /v1/posts`)
        - **External Posts** - Posts synced from social platforms for analytics tracking

        When you schedule a post via Late and it gets published, **both** records exist:
        1. The original Late Post (returned when you created the post)
        2. An External Post (created when we sync analytics from the platform)

        **List endpoint behavior:**
        - Returns External Post IDs (`_id` field)
        - Use the `isExternal` field to identify post origin:
          - `isExternal: true` - Synced from platform (may have been originally scheduled via Late)
          - `isExternal: false` - Late-scheduled post (shown when querying by Late post ID)

        **Single post behavior (`postId` parameter):**
        - Accepts **both** Late Post IDs and External Post IDs
        - If you pass a Late Post ID, the API automatically resolves it to the corresponding External Post analytics
        - Both return the same analytics data for the same underlying social media post

        **Correlating posts:** Use `latePostId` to link analytics entries back to the original post created via `POST /v1/posts`. This field contains the Late Post ID when the external post originated from Late. Alternatively, use `platformPostUrl` (e.g., `https://www.instagram.com/reel/ABC123/`) as a stable identifier.

        **Note:** For follower count history and growth metrics, use the dedicated `/v1/accounts/follower-stats` endpoint.

        **LinkedIn Analytics:**
        - **Personal Accounts:** Per-post analytics available for posts published through Late. External posts cannot be synced due to LinkedIn API restrictions.
        - **Organization Accounts:** Full analytics support including external post syncing.

        **Telegram Analytics:**
        - **Not available.** The Telegram Bot API does not provide message view counts, forwards, or engagement metrics. This is a Telegram platform limitation, not a Late limitation. View counts are only visible to channel admins in the Telegram app.

        **Data Freshness:** Analytics data is cached and refreshed at most once per hour. When you call this endpoint, if the cache is older than 60 minutes, a background refresh is triggered and you'll see updated data on subsequent requests. There is no rate limit on API requests.

        Returns historical daily view counts for a specific YouTube video.
        Uses YouTube Analytics API v2 to fetch daily breakdowns including views,
        watch time, and subscriber changes.

        **Required Scope:** This endpoint requires the `yt-analytics.readonly` OAuth scope.
        Existing YouTube accounts may need to re-authorize to grant this permission.
        If the scope is missing, the response will include a `reauthorizeUrl`.

        **Data Latency:** YouTube Analytics data has a 2-3 day delay. The `endDate`
        is automatically capped to 3 days ago.

        **Date Range:** Maximum 90 days of historical data available. Defaults to last 30 days.

        Get a presigned URL to upload files directly to cloud storage. This is the recommended method for uploading files of any size, especially files larger than ~4MB.

        **How it works:**
        1. Call this endpoint with the filename and content type
        2. Receive an `uploadUrl` (presigned) and `publicUrl`
        3. PUT your file directly to the `uploadUrl`
        4. Use the `publicUrl` in your posts

        **Benefits:**
        - Supports files up to 5GB
        - Files upload directly to storage (faster, no server bottleneck)
        - No 413 errors from server body size limits

        **Example:**
        ```javascript
        // Step 1: Get presigned URL
        const response = await fetch('https://getlate.dev/api/v1/media/presign', {
          method: 'POST',
          headers: {
            'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
          },
          body: JSON.stringify({
            filename: 'my-video.mp4',
            contentType: 'video/mp4'
          })
        });
        const { uploadUrl, publicUrl } = await response.json();

        // Step 2: Upload file directly to storage
        await fetch(uploadUrl, {
          method: 'PUT',
          body: file,
          headers: { 'Content-Type': 'video/mp4' }
        });

        // Step 3: Use publicUrl when creating your post
        // The publicUrl is ready to use immediately after upload completes
        ```

        **Getting Post URLs:**
        For published posts, each platform entry includes `platformPostUrl` with the public URL.
        Use `status=published` filter to fetch only published posts with their URLs.

        Notes and constraints by platform when interpreting the response:
        - YouTube: posts always include at least one video in mediaItems.
        - Instagram/TikTok: posts always include media; drafts may omit media until finalized in client.
        - TikTok: mediaItems will not mix photos and videos in the same post.

        **Getting Post URLs:**
        - For immediate posts (`publishNow: true`): The response includes `platformPostUrl` in each platform entry under `post.platforms[]`.
        - For scheduled posts: Fetch the post via `GET /v1/posts/{postId}` after the scheduled time; `platformPostUrl` will be populated once published.

        **Content/Caption requirements:**
        - `content` (caption/description) is optional when:
          - Media is attached (`mediaItems` or per-platform `customMedia`)
          - All platforms have `customContent` set
          - Posting only to YouTube (title is used instead)
        - Text-only posts (no media) require `content`
        - Stories do not use captions (content is ignored)
        - Reels, feed posts, and other media posts can have optional captions

        Platform constraints:
        - YouTube requires a video in mediaItems; optional custom thumbnail via MediaItem.thumbnail.
        - Instagram and TikTok require media; do not mix videos and images for TikTok.
        - Instagram carousels support up to 10 items; Stories publish as 'story'.
        - Threads carousels support up to 10 images (no videos in carousels); single posts support one image or video.
        - Facebook Stories require media (single image or video); set contentType to 'story' in platformSpecificData.
        - LinkedIn multi-image supports up to 20 images; single PDF documents supported (max 100MB, ~300 pages, cannot mix with other media).
        - Pinterest supports single image via image_url or a single video per Pin; boardId is required.
        - Bluesky supports up to 4 images per post. Images may be automatically recompressed to ≤ ~1MB to satisfy Bluesky's blob limit. When no media is attached, a link preview may be generated for URLs in the text.
        - Snapchat requires media (single image or video); set contentType to 'story', 'saved_story', or 'spotlight' in platformSpecificData. Stories are ephemeral (24h), Saved Stories are permanent, Spotlight is for video content.

        **Multi-page/multi-location posting:**
        Some platforms allow posting to multiple pages, organizations, or locations from a single account connection.
        Use the same accountId multiple times with different targets in platformSpecificData:
        - Facebook: `pageId` - post to multiple Facebook Pages (list via GET /v1/accounts/{id}/facebook-page)
        - LinkedIn: `organizationUrn` - post to multiple organizations (list via GET /v1/accounts/{id}/linkedin-organizations)
        - Google Business: `locationId` - post to multiple locations (list via GET /v1/accounts/{id}/gmb-locations)
        - Reddit: `subreddit` - post to multiple subreddits from the same account

        \ platform.\n\n**Standard Flow (Hosted UI):**\nFor Facebook connections, Late\
        \ hosts the page selection UI:\n\n1. Call this endpoint with your API key\
        \ and `redirect_url` (optional)\n2. Redirect your user to the returned `authUrl`\n\
        3. After OAuth, the user is redirected to Late’s hosted page selector at \
        \ \n   `/connect/facebook/select-page?profileId=X&tempToken=Y&userProfile=Z&redirect_url=YOUR_URL&connect_token=CT`\n\
        4. After they pick a page, Late saves the connection and finally redirects\
        \ to your `redirect_url` (if provided)\n\n**Headless/Whitelabel Mode (Facebook,\
        \ LinkedIn, Pinterest & Google Business Profile):**\nBuild your own fully\
        \ branded selection UI while Late handles OAuth:\n\n**Facebook:**\n1. Call\
        \ this endpoint with your API key and add `&headless=true`, e.g.  \n   `GET\
        \ /v1/connect/facebook?profileId=PROFILE_ID&redirect_url=https://yourapp.com/callback&headless=true`\n\
        2. Redirect your user to the returned `authUrl`\n3. After OAuth, the user\
        \ is redirected directly to **your** `redirect_url` with:\n   - `profileId`\
        \ – your Late profile ID  \n   - `tempToken` – temporary Facebook access token\
        \  \n   - `userProfile` – URL‑encoded JSON user profile  \n   - `connect_token`\
        \ – short‑lived connect token (for API auth)  \n   - `platform=facebook` \
        \ \n   - `step=select_page`\n4. Use `tempToken`, `userProfile`, and the `X-Connect-Token`\
        \ header with:\n   - `GET /v1/connect/facebook/select-page` to fetch pages\n\
        \   - `POST /v1/connect/facebook/select-page` to save the selected page\n\
        5. In this mode, users never see Late's hosted page selector – only your UI.\n\
        \n**LinkedIn:**\n1. Call this endpoint with `&headless=true`, e.g.\n   `GET\
        \ /v1/connect/linkedin?profileId=PROFILE_ID&redirect_url=https://yourapp.com/callback&headless=true`\n\
        2. Redirect your user to the returned `authUrl`\n3. After OAuth, the user\
        \ is redirected directly to **your** `redirect_url` with:\n   - `profileId`\
        \ – your Late profile ID\n   - `pendingDataToken` – token to fetch OAuth data\
        \ via API (see step 4)\n   - `connect_token` – short-lived connect token (for\
        \ API auth)\n   - `platform=linkedin`\n   - `step=select_organization`\n4.\
        \ Call `GET /v1/connect/pending-data?token=PENDING_DATA_TOKEN` to fetch the\
        \ OAuth data:\n   - `tempToken` – temporary LinkedIn access token\n   - `userProfile`\
        \ – JSON object with `id`, `username`, `displayName`, `profilePicture`\n \
        \  - `organizations` – JSON array with `id`, `urn`, `name`, `vanityName` for\
        \ each org\n   - `refreshToken` / `expiresIn` – token metadata\n   This endpoint\
        \ is one-time use and data expires after 10 minutes.\n5. **Optional:** To\
        \ fetch full organization details (logos, website, industry, description),\
        \ call `GET /v1/connect/linkedin/organizations?tempToken=X&orgIds=id1,id2,...`\n\
        6. Call `POST /v1/connect/linkedin/select-organization` with the `X-Connect-Token`\
        \ header to save the selection.\n7. In this mode, users never see Late's hosted\
        \ organization selector – only your UI.\n8. Note: If the user has no organization\
        \ admin access, `step=select_organization` will NOT be present,\n   and the\
        \ account will be connected directly as a personal account.\n\n**Pinterest:**\n\
        1. Call this endpoint with `&headless=true`, e.g.\n   `GET /v1/connect/pinterest?profileId=PROFILE_ID&redirect_url=https://yourapp.com/callback&headless=true`\n\
        2. Redirect your user to the returned `authUrl`\n3. After OAuth, the user\

        \ – short‑lived connect token (for API auth)\n   - `platform=pinterest`\n\

        \   - `POST /v1/connect/pinterest/select-board` to save the selected board\n\
        5. In this mode, users never see Late's hosted board selector – only your\
        \ UI.\n\n**Google Business Profile:**\n1. Call this endpoint with `&headless=true`,\
        \ e.g.\n   `GET /v1/connect/googlebusiness?profileId=PROFILE_ID&redirect_url=https://yourapp.com/callback&headless=true`\n\
        2. Redirect your user to the returned `authUrl`\n3. After OAuth, the user\

        \   - `platform=googlebusiness`\n   - `step=select_location`\n4. Use `tempToken`,\
        \ `userProfile`, and the `X-Connect-Token` header with:\n   - `GET /v1/connect/googlebusiness/locations`\
        \ to fetch business locations\n   - `POST /v1/connect/googlebusiness/select-location`\

        **Fetch Pending OAuth Data for Headless Mode**

        In headless mode, platforms like LinkedIn store OAuth selection data (organizations, pages, etc.)
        in the database instead of passing it via URL parameters. This prevents URI_TOO_LONG errors
        when users have many organizations/pages to select from.

        After OAuth redirect, use the `pendingDataToken` from the URL to fetch the stored data.

        **Important:**
        - This endpoint is one-time use: data is deleted after being fetched
        - Data expires automatically after 10 minutes if not fetched
        - No authentication required, just the token from the redirect URL

        **Fetch Full Organization Details for Custom UI**

        After LinkedIn OAuth in headless mode, the redirect URL contains organization data with only
        `id`, `urn`, and `name` fields (additional details are excluded to prevent URL length issues with many organizations).

        Use this endpoint to fetch full organization details including logos, vanity names, websites, and more
        if you want to display them in your custom selection UI.

        **Note:** This endpoint requires no authentication - just the `tempToken` from the OAuth redirect.
        Details are fetched directly from LinkedIn's API in parallel for fast response times.

        After OAuth, use this endpoint to save the selected Public Profile and complete the Snapchat account connection.
        Snapchat requires a Public Profile to publish Stories, Saved Stories, and Spotlight content.

        **Headless Mode:** Use the `X-Connect-Token` header if you initiated the connection via API key.

        After initiating Snapchat OAuth via `/v1/connect/snapchat?headless=true`, you'll be redirected to
        your `redirect_url` with query params including:
        - `tempToken` - Temporary access token

        - `connect_token` - Short-lived token for API authentication
        - `platform=snapchat`
        - `step=select_public_profile`

        Parse `publicProfiles` to build your custom selector UI, then call this endpoint with the selected profile.

        Returns aggregate analytics across ALL posts for a LinkedIn personal account.
        Uses LinkedIn's `memberCreatorPostAnalytics` API with `q=me` finder.

        **Important:** This endpoint only works for LinkedIn **personal** accounts. Organization accounts should use the standard `/v1/analytics` endpoint for per-post analytics.

        **Required Scope:** `r_member_postAnalytics`

        If the connected account doesn't have this scope, you'll receive a 403 error with instructions to reconnect.

        **Aggregation Options:**
        - `TOTAL` (default): Returns lifetime totals for all metrics
        - `DAILY`: Returns daily breakdown of metrics over time

        **Available Metrics:**
        - `IMPRESSION`: Number of times posts were displayed
        - `MEMBERS_REACHED`: Unique members who saw posts (NOT available with DAILY aggregation)
        - `REACTION`: Total reactions (likes, celebrates, etc.)
        - `COMMENT`: Total comments
        - `RESHARE`: Total reshares/reposts

        **Date Range Filtering:**
        Use `startDate` and `endDate` parameters to filter analytics to a specific time period.
        If omitted, returns lifetime analytics.

        **LinkedIn API Limitation:** The combination of `MEMBERS_REACHED` + `DAILY` aggregation is not supported by LinkedIn's API.

        Converts a LinkedIn profile URL (person) or company page URL (organization) to a URN that can be used to @mention them in posts.

        **Supports both:**
        - **Person mentions:** `linkedin.com/in/username` or just `username`
        - **Organization mentions:** `linkedin.com/company/company-name` or `company/company-name`

        **⚠️ Organization Admin Required for Person Mentions Only:**
        Person mentions require the connected LinkedIn account to have admin access to at least one LinkedIn Organization (Company Page).
        Organization mentions do NOT have this requirement - any LinkedIn account can tag companies.

        **IMPORTANT - Display Name Requirement:**
        For **person mentions** to be clickable, the display name must **exactly match** what appears on their LinkedIn profile.
        - Organization mentions automatically retrieve the company name from LinkedIn API
        - Person mentions require the exact name, so provide the `displayName` parameter

        **Mention Format:**
        Use the returned `mentionFormat` value directly in your post content:

        Returns the next available queue slot for preview/informational purposes.

        **Important: To schedule a post to the queue, do NOT use this endpoint's response
        with `scheduledFor`.** That creates a manual post, not a queue post.

        Instead, use `POST /v1/posts` with `queuedFromProfile` (and optionally `queueId`).
        The system will automatically assign the next available slot with proper locking
        to prevent race conditions.

        This endpoint is useful for:
        - Showing users when their next post will go out before they commit
        - Debugging/verifying queue configuration
        - Building UI previews

        If no queueId is specified, uses the profile's default queue.

        Send a private direct message to the author of a comment on your post.
        This is useful for handling customer inquiries or sensitive matters privately.

        **Supported platforms:** Instagram only

        **Limitations:**
        - Instagram only allows ONE private reply per comment
        - Must be sent within 7 days of the comment being posted
        - Only works for comments on posts owned by the connected account
        - Message goes to the user's Inbox (if they follow you) or Message Requests (if they don't)
        - Requires `instagram_business_manage_messages` permission (already included in Late's OAuth)

        **Note:** This does not create a conversation thread until the user replies back.

    MediaItem:
      description: |
        Media referenced in posts. URLs must be publicly reachable over HTTPS by the destination platforms.
        When using third‑party storage, ensure signed links remain valid until upload completes.

        **Uploading Media:**
        Use `POST /v1/media/presign` to get a presigned URL, then upload your file directly to cloud storage.
        Supports files up to 5GB. See the `/v1/media/presign` endpoint documentation for details.

        **Automatic Media Compression:**
        Late automatically compresses media that exceeds platform limits, so you don't need to worry about file size restrictions. Compression happens server-side during publishing.

        **Image compression by platform:**
        - Twitter/X: >5 MB
        - Instagram: >8 MB
        - Threads: >8 MB
        - Facebook: >10 MB
        - LinkedIn: >8 MB
        - TikTok: >20 MB
        - Pinterest: >32 MB
        - Reddit: >20 MB
        - Snapchat: >20 MB
        - Telegram: >10 MB
        - Bluesky: >1 MB
        - YouTube (thumbnails): >2 MB
        - Google Business: >5 MB

        **Video compression by platform:**
        - Twitter/X: >512 MB
        - Instagram Stories: >100 MB
        - Instagram Reels: >300 MB
        - Facebook: >4 GB
        - LinkedIn: >5 GB
        - TikTok: >4 GB
        - Pinterest: >2 GB
        - Snapchat: >500 MB
        - Telegram: >50 MB

        Note: Videos larger than 200 MB may not be compressed due to server timeout constraints. For best results, compress very large videos before uploading.

            This is a convenience shorthand. Settings here are merged into each TikTok
            platform's platformSpecificData, with platform-specific settings taking precedence.
        queuedFromProfile:
          description: |
            Profile ID to schedule via queue.

            When provided (without `scheduledFor`), the post will be automatically assigned
            to the next available slot from the profile's queue. The system uses distributed
            locking to prevent race conditions when multiple posts are scheduled concurrently.
            Do not call `/v1/queue/next-slot` and then use that time in `scheduledFor`.
            That bypasses the queue system and can cause duplicate slot assignments.
          type: string
        queueId:
          description: |
            Specific queue ID to use when scheduling via queue.
            Only used when queuedFromProfile is also provided.
            If omitted, uses the profile's default queue.
